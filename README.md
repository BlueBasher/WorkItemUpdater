# WorkItem Updater

## Overview
The WorkItem Updater task can update workitems using a Query or that are linked to the Build/Release.  
The following workitem fields can be updated:
- Update the state for workitems.  
- Update the assignee for workitems.  
- Update the swimlane or board-column for workitems.  
- Add the build as Development Link to the workitems.
  
By adding this task to specific milestones in a build/release pipeline, you can create an automated kanban board.  
An example would be to set the state to 'Resolved' as the last step of a build and to 'Deployed' as the last step of a release.  
With this task the state of workitems is always reflecting reality and developers don't need to manually update workitems anymore.  
  
A preview of what the task can do, can be seen in this recording:
